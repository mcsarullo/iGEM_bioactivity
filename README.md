# iGEM_bioactivity
This repo only consists of the primary ML pipeline used in the 2025 Yale iGEM project, where we aim to predict pPaF incorporation sites within the biologic chemotherapy L-asparaginase based on protein dynamics, molecular docking, and protein stability. Other data and scripts will be released post-conference (November 2025).
